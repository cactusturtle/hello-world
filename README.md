# hello-world

Hello, world! I am Joci!

I am learning how to code using primarily python.
I also have experience with C and C#.
I focus mostly on Object Oriented Programming styles, they are the 
most difficult for me but **I LOVE A GOOD CHALLENGE**.
My current project is a casual video game using the Godot Engine and 
its native language gdscript, which is a lot like python though it has 
shortcomings that are becoming harder to overlook. Thus I may soon go 
back to using Unity with C#. (Absolutley have not decided yet)
I have also dabbled with HTML and CSS and building simple static pages, 
and I am pretty desperate to learn more about web development.

I am starting to learn how to use github. I have tried a little bit before,  
but my old laptop had a hard time handling *anything* that wasn't just overheating,
haha! I have finally gotten a machine that does not crash all the time and 
 moves at more than a dead snails pace. I am very excited to upload my projects 
 for others to see and hopefully critique.
